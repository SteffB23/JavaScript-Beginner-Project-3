## Description
The 3rd project in a quest to become the very best 😅
AS A spectator I WANT to create a list of things to do on some simple looking list 😅 SO THAT I can say "Yeah, thats a begginer noob"

GIVEN I open the page theres a form with buttons for me to type in and click on
WHEN I enter words into the form and click "add", it at least adds an item that can be crossed out and/or removed from the page
